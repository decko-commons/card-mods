# Classic mod

The classic mod bundles the standard default mods along with other mods that _
used to be standard_ but are no longer defaults. Most of the mods in the
list (`google analytics`, `alias`, and `prosemirror`) are still well supported
but have been made optional in order to streamline default decks.

The `legacy` mod, however, will not be well supported moving forward, as its
name implies.

In most cases, those who want the other three mods will be better suited to
include those mods in their Gemfile rather than to use this mod and include the
clunky legacy mod. This bundle is provided predominantly as a transition tool
for anyone hoping to minimize or delay changes to their site.

Beyond specifying dependencies (in card-mod-classic.gemspec), this mod adds no
code.
