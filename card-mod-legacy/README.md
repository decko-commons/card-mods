# Legacy mod

This mod houses a collection of deprecated Decko functionality, specifically old rule 
_settings_ that were moved out to reduce noise and make room for implementations more
consistent with Decko best practices.

The mod is provided to help folks retain old functionality but not recommended for those
not already addicted.

## Functionality

One set of functionality, the **table of contents**, is a fine concept for a mod, but the
old rule-based implementation did not age well. Poor shark ui, inefficient rendering,
difficult to customize... Not a keeper.

Similarly, the old **csv structure** and **default html view** rules had merit, but both
were seldom used and would in any event be superceded by the coming _format rules_.
