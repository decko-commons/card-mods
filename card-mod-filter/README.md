# Filter mod

This mod provides a framework for enhancing card searches with advanced filtering
interfaces. 

Include the Abstract::Filter set in any search set to add both:

- a `filter_form` view with progressive disclosure filter accordions inside an offcanvas, 
  and
- a `compact_filter_form` view that opens compact filter interfaces in place above search
  results.

The mod also adds support for a `filtered_list` view of list/pointer cards that makes it
easier to choose list items from options too numerous or complicated to fit into a 
standard dropdown.
